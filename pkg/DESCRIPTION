Description: Routines to find the root of nonlinear functions, and to perform steady-state and equilibrium analysis of ordinary differential equations (ODE). 
  Includes routines that: (1) generate gradient and Jacobian matrices (full and banded),
  (2) find roots of non-linear equations by the Newton-Raphson method, 
  (3) estimate steady-state conditions of a system of (differential) equations in full, banded or sparse form, using the Newton-Raphson method, or by dynamically running,
  (4) solve the steady-state conditions for uni-and multicomponent 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D partial differential equations, that have been converted to ODEs
    by numerical differencing (using the method-of-lines approach).
  Includes fortran code.
